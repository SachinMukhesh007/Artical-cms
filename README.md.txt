
I chose to run the project using the App Service rather than VM as 
a VM needs managing in comparison App Service which is setup for you 
upon registering. The step by step process of simply creating over an 
App Service requires less experience and understanding over some 
technicalities that can come with a VM. The project is quite basic to 
setup across the server so running on a VM is a bit of an overkill. 
Deployment is a lot more straightforward from the Portal environment 
rather than losing time deploying on a VM.
